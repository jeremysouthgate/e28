# Project 3
+ By: Jeremy C. Southgate ([jes4532@g.harvard.edu](http://mailto:jes4532@g.harvard.edu))
+ Production URL: <http://p3.sprk.me>


## Outline of features
"MyMusic" is an app to play any given "collection" from a catalog of music files.

## Outside resources
<https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_av_dom.asp>

## Notes for instructor
+ Right now, only one song is played. P4 will implement "playing through" an album or playlist.

+ I will also break down these main components into futher sub-components -- code is a little too messy
and Vue is too awesome not to do this.
