# Project 4
+ By: Jeremy C. Southgate ([jes4532@g.harvard.edu](http://mailto:jes4532@g.harvard.edu))

## Outline of features
+ Repurposed the music player to fit a smaller portfolio of music. Messed with CSS
to add some responsiveness.
+ Completed multi-track list of songs that link to their players.
+ Vuelidate Contact form expects server-side implementation.
+ VueX would have been useful for parent-child variable passing (like P2) but
here MmPlayer.vue is already self-contained, so I just demo'd it.
+ Netlify was a breeze.

## Notes for instructor
Had a rough finals week with a cold, so there wasn't much time for testing.

Thank you for a great 2 semesters!
